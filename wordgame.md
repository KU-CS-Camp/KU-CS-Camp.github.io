## Word Game
This project does not involve machine learning but is Python practice and a fun game. This word game asks users to guess a secret word. They will get to know if their guess is the right length then how many letters they have correct until they guess correctly. You could consider this game similar to Wordle.

The game will do the following:
- Make an array of words (as many as you want)
- Choose a word from the array at random
- Ask the player to input a word
    - If the word they enter is not the same length as the goal word, print out if it was too short or too long and have them guess again
    - If their word in the correct length but not the exact word, print out how many letters they have correct and have them guess again
    - If they guess the exact word, print out congratulations and end the game
