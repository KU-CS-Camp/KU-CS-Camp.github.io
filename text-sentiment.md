## Text Sentiment Identifier

In this project, you will use the Na√Øve Bayesian classifier to build a text sentiment identifier. Your dataset will include sentences and whether it has a positive or negative sentiment. I will provide starter/skeleton code (code that is partially complete) for you to work on. There are comments with TODOs that you need to finish in order for the code to run.

Download the starter code [here](text-emotion.py)

Download the dataset [here](datasets/naivetext.csv)
