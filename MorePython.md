### Guess a Number Game
Create a program that will make the user guess a random number between 1 and 100. The game won't end until the user guesses the correct number, but along the way you will help the user.

Until the user guesses the secret number:
- Obtain a guess
- If it's higher than the number, tell the user
- If it's lower than the number, tell the user
- If they guess the number, the game stops and they are prompted to either play again or exit

After they win...
- Congratulate them
- Tell them how many guesses it took
