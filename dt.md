## Car Sales Predictor
This project will act as a refresher of the machine learning process we looked at yesterday while utilizing the new classifier we learned about today (decision tree classifier). The data for this project revolves around car sales and the gender, age, and income features that can impact the decision to buy a car. Once you have trained and tested your decision tree model, you will ask for input from the terminal to make a new prediction and display those results.

I will provide starter code for this project, but it does not contain much syntax. The steps for this project should be very similar to your projects from yesterday so refer back to your previous work for help.
