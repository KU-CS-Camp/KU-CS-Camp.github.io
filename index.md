## Welcome to Summer Camp!

This website will be used for distributing our projects. I will also attach the slides we go over that can be used as reference while you work on projects.

### Running Code on Lab Machines
In order to ensure all of the programs you write run correctly, we have create a virtual machine that you will use to run your code. This sounds fancy and complicated but all it will require you to do is run a single command every time you open a new terminal window. The command is:

```
source 2022summercamp/bin/activate
```

If you run programs in a terminal without running this command first, there is a chance your program will fail due to import errors.

### Friday Session

#### Outline
- Create Presentation
- Presentation Runthrough

What to include in your presentation slide(s):
- Describe the task
    - What was in the dataset?
    - What was the goal?
- What machine learning concepts/tools did you use to complete the process?
- What were the results?
    - Include pictures of graphs and/or terminal output
    - Metrics calculated


Each table will present as a group.
Here are the group numbers:

```

Extra Neural Network Project: Follow [this online tutorial](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/05/movie-recommendations-using-keras-recommender-systems/) using [this dataset](/datasets/data.csv) to create a movie recommendation system.

Try to Create these Games:
- Rock, Paper, Scissors (get terminal input and play against AI choosing a random action)
