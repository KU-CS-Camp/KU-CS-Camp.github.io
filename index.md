## Welcome to Summer Camp!

This website will be used for distributing our projects. I will also attach the slides we go over that can be used as reference while you work on projects.

### Running Code on Lab Machines
In order to ensure all of the programs you write run correctly, we have create a virtual machine that you will use to run your code. This sounds fancy and complicated but all it will require you to do is run a single command every time you open a new terminal window. The command is:

```
source 2022summercamp/bin/activate
```

If you run programs in a terminal without running this command first, there is a chance your program will fail due to import errors.

#### Slides
[Tuesday Session 2](/slides/CampTu2.pptx)

#### Projects

[Stock Predictor](/stock-predictor.md)

Try to Create these Games:
- Guess the number game (generate a random integer from a range of 1-100, ask players to guess a number, have them keep guessing until they are correct)
- Mad Libs (Think of sentences like 'I can't start my day without my blank!' and ask the user for a noun/adjective/etc to fill in the blank, then display the completed sentence or story)
- Rock, Paper, Scissors (get terminal input and play against AI choosing a random action)
- Hangman

More Difficult Games:
- Tic Tac Toe
- Battleship
- Snake
- Pong

### Tuesday Session 1

#### Outline
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Neural Networks
- Deep Learning

#### Slides
[Tuesday Session 1](/slides/CampTu1.pptx)

#### Projects

[Car Sales Predictor](/dt.md)

[Digit Identifier](/digit-identifier.md)

#### Python Challenges

- Guess the number game: generate a random integer from a range of 1-100, ask players to guess a number, have them keep guessing until they are correct
- Emulate Dice Role: follow [this tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-dice-roll/)
- Battleship game (you will need to look into 2D arrays): create a battleship game against a simple AI, a player will enter a turn through the terminal, the AI will take its turn by randomly selecting a spot, base your implementation on the [actual rules](https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/battleship.pdf) of battleship
