## Welcome to Summer Camp!

This website will be used for downloading starter code for our projects. I will also attach the slides we go over that can be used as reference while you work on projects.

### Running Code on Lab Machines
In order to ensure all of the programs you write run correctly, we have create a virtual machine that you will use to run your code. This sounds fancy and complicated but all it will require you to do is run a single command every time you open a new terminal window. The command is:

```
source 2022summercamp/bin/activate
```

If you run programs in a terminal without running this command first, there is a chance your program will fail due to import errors.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/KU-CS-Camp/KU-CS-Camp.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
