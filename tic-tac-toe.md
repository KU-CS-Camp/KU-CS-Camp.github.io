## Tic Tac Toe

Who doesn't love a good game of tic tac toe? In this project, we will use reinforcement learning, more specifically Q-learning, to teach an agent how to play tic tac toe.

This project will require a good amount of extra code to run the game, so I will provide you 'skeleton' code. This basically means I will provide a partially filled out layout/template of code that you will need to finish for the project to be complete. I use the keyword 'TODO' to signify where you will need to work in the file.

Download the code [here](tictactoe.py)
